                               Compound, Cytochrome and Marker mentions can be curated at the sentence level from the results table. The curation process consists in confirming (checbox) or denying (crossbox) the association between that entity and the hepatotoxic effect inside the sentence. A total number is associated to that relation in the way that checkbox will add (+1) to the total count while crossbox will sustract (-1) to the total count.
